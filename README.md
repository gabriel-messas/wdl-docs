# wdl-docs
Documentation for learning and writing in the Workflow Description Language (WDL), including introductory articles, tutorials and coding examples.

## Why wdl-docs?
WDL is a community effort. We want to consolidate WDL materials and allow the community to contribute to this collective knowledge base. 

## How does the repo work?
There are two development branches:
* draft-2: materials developed primarily for draft-2 the WDL language
* 1.0: materials developed or updated for the 1.0 spec
